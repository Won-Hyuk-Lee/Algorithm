### 문제 설명

<p>If the Roman Empire had not fallen, then Rome would surely have discovered electricity and used electronic calculators; however, the Romans used Roman Numerals! Your task is to implement a simple Roman Calculator which accepts two Roman Numerals and outputs the sum in Roman Numerals. You may assume that numbers greater than 1000 will not occur in the input. Output numbers greater than 1000 are illegal and should generate the message <samp>CONCORDIA CUM VERITATE</samp> (In Harmony with Truth).</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a number, indicating the number of test cases, followed by this many test cases. Each test case consists of a single line with two numbers in Roman Numerals separated by a <code>+</code> along with an <code>=</code> at the end. There are no separating spaces.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case the output is a copy of the input with the Roman Numeral that represents the sum. Outputs for different test cases are separated by a blank line.</p>
